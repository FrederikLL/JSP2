# JS Period 2 handIn


## Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using, for example, Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat

## (y) Explain the difference between Debug outputs and ApplicationLogging. What’s wrong with console.log(..) statements in our backend code.

## (y) Demonstrate a system using application logging and environment controlled debug statements.

## Explain, using relevant examples, concepts related to testing a REST-API using Node/JavaScript/Typescript + relevant packages 

## Explain a setup for Express/Node/Test/Mongo-DB development with Typescript, and how it handles "secret values", debug and testing.

(        
## Explain, preferably using an example, how you have deployed your node/Express applications, and which of the Express Production best ## practices you have followed.

## Explain possible steps to deploy many node/Express servers on the same droplet, how to deploy the code and how to ensure servers will ## continue to operate, even after a droplet restart.

## Explain, your chosen strategy to deploy a Node/Express application including how to solve the following deployment problems:
## - Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a (potential) exception that closed the application
## - Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a server (Ubuntu) restart
## - Ensure that you can run “many” node-applications on a single droplet on the same port (80)
)

## Explain, using relevant examples, the Express concept; middleware.

## Explain, using relevant examples, your strategy for implementing a REST-API with Node/Express  + TypeScript and demonstrate how you ## have tested the API.

## Explain, using relevant examples, how to test JavaScript/Typescript Backend Code, relevant packages (Mocha, Chai etc.) and how to test 
## asynchronous code.

## NoSQL and MongoDB 

## Explain, generally, what is meant by a NoSQL database.

## (y) Explain Pros & Cons in using a NoSQL database like MongoDB as your data store, compared to a traditional Relational SQL Database ## like MySQL.

## Explain about indexes in MongoDB, how to create them, and demonstrate how you have used them.

## Explain, using your own code examples, how you have used some of MongoDB's "special" indexes like TTL and 2dsphere and perhaps also ## the Unique Index.

## Demonstrate, using a REST-API you have designed, how to perform all CRUD operations on a MongoDB

## Explain, using a relevant example, a full JavaScript backend including relevant test cases to test the REST-API (not on the ## production ##database)

## (r) Demonstrate, using your own code-samples, decisions you have made regarding → normalization vs denormalization

## Geo-location and Geojson


## Explain and demonstrate basic Geo-JSON, involving as a minimum, Points and Polygons

## (y) Explain and demonstrate ways to create Geo-JSON test data

## (y) Explain the typical order of longitude and latitude used by Server-Side API’s and Client-Side API’s

## Explain and demonstrate a REST API that implements geo-features, using a relevant geo-library and plain JavaScript

## Explain and demonstrate a REST API that implements geo-features, using Mongodb’s geospatial queries and indexes.

## This will come in period-3

## Explain and demonstrate a React Native Client that uses geo-components (Location, MapView, etc.)

## Demonstrate both server and client-side, of the geo-related parts of your implementation of the ongoing semester case.
